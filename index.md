This site is about technology, about what I study, what I learn, what I'd like to learn and will never have a chance to... and you will find bits of me and my life in it too, of course!

Its name comes straight from the past century game "Tetris". `Tetriminos` was the name of those little pieces falling from the sky, which the player had to place in a way to complete a line in order for it to disappear and make space for new pieces.

To me, that is the perfect metaphor of lifelong learning. You keep studying day after day, possibly in a way that all your knowledge fit together in a productive way. Over time, some of those learning will become useless and you can put it away in order to make space for something else.

This was always my approach to learning. Search for something new, study it, use it, put it away, repeat. Sometime I did it for work; sometime I made it purely for myself. Sometime I used it; sometime I didn't. That was never the point, anyway.

Learning this way, overtime I accumulated a diverse set of knowledge and skills that allow me today - in my current role as Architect - to understand a diverse set of technologies, some of which I never worked with directly. I guess you can call me a "generalist": I sacrificed the tree for the forest, and this today allows me to grasp connections that most of my colleagues do not even notice.

Anyhow, after more of 30 years of learning I start to feel the pressure of all those falling pieces. There's still much space left, but there are also too many `S` pieces. If you ever played Tetris, you know what I mean. Those pieces were the most difficult to place, leaving holes and gaps difficult to fill. You had to play smart, accepting the holes for some time, building around them until you get that single piece that allowed you to dispose of 5 rows in a shot.

I feel I've got too many `S` pieces so far, so this site is part of my strategy to arrange them in a row and make space. I was out of coding for too much now: it's time for me to fall back a little and get back my programming skill. I want to get back that beautiful sensation you get when finally the machine concede to you and obey your wishes.

If you expect to find here astonishing piece of code well... maybe later, maybe never. This site it to organize my old and new knowledge, mainly for myself.

Over time I tried different media: Linkedin, Facebook, Wordpress, Medium. None of them really satisfied me, so I decided to get back to the roots and try with a personal website.

I found that GitHub Pages was a fast way to start working, without having to do a complete setup from scratch. If this experiment will succeed, I will move the content to a "real" website. If not, at least I will have all my content in a single place, owned by me and not by someone else.

I hope some of the knowledge I will place here will be useful to you too. It's free, as all knowledge should be. So, if you find it useful, use it and send me a backlink if you feel to.
