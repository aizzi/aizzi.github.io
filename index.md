I used to have 


This site is about technology, about what I study, what I learn, what I'd like to learn and will never have a chance to... and you will find bits of me and my life in it too, of course!

The name comes straight from the past century game "Tetris": if you don't know it, there are only two cases:
1. you are not interested into technology and programming
2. you are damn too young... or I'm becoming too old

Anyhow, looking at what I learned so far I suddenly felt as I've got too many S pieces so far, so this site is my attempt to arrange them in a row. If you expect to find here astonishing piece of code well... maybe later, maybe never.

This is an attempt to organize my old and new knowledge, mainly for myself. Over time I tried different media: Linkedin, Facebook, Wordpress. None of them really satisfied me, so I decided to try with a website. GitHub Pages is a fast way to start experimenting, without having to do a complete setup. If the experiment will succeed, I will move the content to a "real" website. If not, at least I will have all my content in a single place.
