# How to backup the ebooks you buy on Amazon

## Useful links
The following are some links I checked to develop this tutorial
1. http://www.geoffstratton.com/remove-drm-amazon-kindle-books

## Step 1 : Install Calibre
The *Calibre e-book management utility* can be downloaded [here](https://calibre-ebook.com/). Follow the instruction on the site to install it.

## Step 2 : Download the DRM removal tool
The *Apprentice Alf's DRM removal tools for ebooks* can be downloaded [here](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/). It is a zip archive. Extract it in a place where you can retrieve it.

## Step 3 : Install the plugin in calibre
1. Start Calibre
2. Go to `Preferences` ==> `Advanced` ==> `Plugins`
3. Click on `Load plugin from file` button
4. From the location where you extracted the plugin to in *Step 2*, select the file `DeDRM_calibre_plugin`==>`DeDRM_plugin.zip` and click Open.

## Step 4 : Install the KFX conversion plugin
1. Download the plugin from [here](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=291290)

## Step 5 : Restart Calibre
In order to make the newly installed plugins effective, you must restart the Calibre application.

## Import the Book into Calibre
Calibre will automatically strip the DRM and place the new book into its library.

## Convert the file to a different format
