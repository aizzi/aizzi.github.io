## Assumptions
This tutorial assume the following knowledge on your side:

1. Python 3.8 is installed and working in your system
2. [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) framework installed and working. If you need help to install it, this is the [download page](https://kivy.org/#download) with related instructions.

Be aware that at the moment of writing, the current version of Kivy is 1.11.0. However, since it does not support Python 3.8, I used the version 2.0rc1 using the following commands:

```
pip install kivy[base] --pre --extra-index-url https://kivy.org/downloads/simple
pip install kivy_examples --pre --extra-index-url https://kivy.org/downloads/simple
```

## Why Kivy
Although nowadays web interfaces are the last trend, there are times when a good old desktop interface is still the better choice for several reasons.

I'm working on a side project where I found those reasons to be valid, so I searched for a suitable desktop framework in Python and found [Kivy](https://kivy.org/). It is cross platform and (apparently) well supported, so I decided to give it a try and started experimenting.

My first need was to create a simple chat interface, and I wasn't able to find any tutorial for such a task. So I decided to write one out of my experiments.

This is what this tutorial is about. Please, consider that I know practically nothing about Kivy at the moment. It's been only a couple of day I'm playing with it. I'm sure that things can be done better, but *done is better than good*.

## The Requirements
This is the use case I want to answer to

1. The User insert a message (`user_question`) into the Desktop console
2. The `user_question` is echoed into the `chat_console` on the Desktop
3. The `user_question` is sent to the `chat_server`
4. The `chat_server` evaluate a `server_answer`
5. The `server_answer` is sent back to the `chat_console`
6. The `chat_console` echoes the `server_answer` for the User to read

## The Desktop Interface
The first step of this tutorial is to create the desktop interface for the User to input the `user_question`.

Create two files to hold your code:

* `console.py` for the logic
* `console.kv` for the view layout

Edit the `console.py` and create the skeleton of your application:

```
#console.py

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout
from kivy.properties import ObjectProperty


class ConsoleController(BoxLayout):
    """
    Define the main Controller window of the application. This is a BoxLayout that arranges children in a vertical way.
    """

    pass


class ConsoleApp(App):
    """
    The Console Application
    """

    def build(self):
        self.title = "Chat Console"
        return ConsoleController()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    ConsoleApp().run()
```

Nothing fancy here. We define a class `ConsoleApp` based on the [Kivy App class](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.app.html). It creates the main window for the application and will add to it the `ConsoleController` widget as the `root widget`.

The `ConsoleController` is based on the `[BoxLayout](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.boxlayout.html#kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout)` widget. This is basically a container for other widgets, that can be arranged either vertically or horizontally. We'll arrange them vertically: the `chat window` on top, the `input control` at the bottom.

The layout of the `ConsoleController` is described into the `console.kv` file:

```
#:kivy 2.0

<ConsoleController>:
    orientation: 'vertical'

```

Go on and execute `console.py`. If everything is fine, you should see the following window.

![Fig. 1 - starting point](/assets/img/kivy_chat/img01.PNG)

It does not contain anything yet, so let's define the `chat_widget` and the `input_widget`. Move to `console.kv` and modify `<ConsoleController>` in the following way:

```
<ConsoleController>:
    orientation: 'vertical'
    Label:
        id: chat_widget_id
        text: "Welcome to the Chat Widget"
        size_hint: (1,1)
    TextInput:
        id: input_widget_id
        multiline: False
        size_hint: (1, None)
        hint_text: "Your message here"
        height: self.minimum_height
```

The `[Label](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.label.html)` section define our `chat widget`, where we will store our conversation's text. `id` assigns an identifier to it, so that we can refer to it from other widgets. `text` define its content. `size_hint` is a responsive statement to assign the widget all available space in the window (everything except the `TextInput` define below).

The `[TextInput](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.textinput.html)` section define the `input_widget` for user's input. `size_hint(1, None)` means it will use all the horizontal space, but will not follow on the vertical dimension. This is defined by the `height` properties to be exactly the minimum needed to contain the text.

Now, you should see the following when you execute your console.

![Fig. 2](/assets/img/kivy_chat/img02.PNG)

and you should be able to insert your text in the `TextInput` field.

## Echoing The User Input

The next step is to echo the user's input into the `chat_widget`. To do so, modify the `TextInput` section in the `console.kv` by adding the following line to it:

```
on_text_validate: root.chat_input_callback(self.text)
```

`on_text_validate` is an event that is generated when we hit `ENTER` into the `TextInput` widget. We are binding it to the function `chat_input_callback` in the `ConsoleController` widget. This function will receive the input text (`self.text`), will modify the `chat_widget` text to show it and will clear the .

To do so, we need a way to access the widget's instances defined in the kv file from the python code. We do this with `ObjectProperties`. Add the following two lines into the `console.kv` file, right before the `orientation` property of the `ConsoleController`:

```
chat_widget: chat_widget_id
input_widget: input_widget_id
```

This way we define two objects that we can reference from the associated Python code, and point them to the objects identified by the related id.

Now, modify the `ConsoleController` class in `console.py` in the following way:

```
class ConsoleController(BoxLayout):
    """
    Define the main Controller window of the application. This is a BoxLayout that arranges children in a vertical way.
    """

    chat_widget = ObjectProperty(None)
    input_widget = ObjectProperty(None)

    def AddMessageToChatHistory(self, message):
        self.chat_widget.text = message

    def chat_input_callback(self, message):
        self.AddMessageToChatHistory(message)
        self.input_widget.text = ""
        return False
```

The code above is pretty straightforward to read.

```
chat_widget = ObjectProperty(None)
input_widget = ObjectProperty(None)
```

creates two objects we can reference into the class. Kivy will associate them to the right object's instances in the view.

```
def chat_input_callback(self, message):
    self.AddMessageToChatHistory(message)
    self.input_widget.text = ""
    return False
```

This function receives the `message` from the event handler we defined in the `console.kv` file, pass it to the `AddMessageToChatHistory` to modify the chat history, clear the input text and stop the propagation of the event (`return False`).

```
def AddMessageToChatHistory(self, message):
    self.chat_widget.text = message
```

This function replace the `chat_widget` text with the user's input.

Now execute `console.py`, enter some text in the input field and press enter. If everything is fine, your chat window should change to show your message.

![Fig. 3](/assets/img/kivy_chat/img03.PNG)

## Keeping The Chat History

The next step is to build the chat history. Let's start by adding a white background to the chat window. Unfortunately, the `Label` class cannot set a foreground, so we need a workaround here.

Modify the `console.kv` by adding the following classes before the `ConsoleController` section:

```
<BackgroundColor@Widget>:
    background_color: 1,1,1,1
    canvas.before:
        Color:
            rgba: root.background_color
        Rectangle:
            size: self.size
            pos: self.pos

<BackgroundLabel@Label+BackgroundColor>:
    background_color: 0,0,0,0
```

`BackgroundColor` defines a class that inherit from `Widget`, which has a background color property to set.

`BackgroundLabel` inherits from both `Label` and `BackgroundColor` classes. So, it is basically a label with a background color. Now, let's modify `ConsoleController` to use `BackgroundLabel` instead of label and we have a chat window with a white background.

Now, add the following properties

```
color: 0,0,0,1  # to set black text
```

and voil√†, we have a chat window with white background and black text.

Now, let's modify the `AddMessageToChatHistory` to keep the message's History

```
def AddMessageToChatHistory(self, message):
    chat_text = self.chat_widget.text
    chat_text = chat_text + "\n\n" + message
    self.chat_widget.text = chat_text
```

Go on and execute your new console. Insert a couple of message and check the result:

![Fig. 4](/assets/img/kivy_chat/img04.PNG)

## Align To The Left

The next steps will be to align the text to the left.

To do so, modify the `BackgroundLabel` by adding the following properties:

```
text_size: self.size
halign: 'left'
```

Restart your application, insert a couple of messages and check that everything is working fine.

![Fig. 5](/assets/img/kivy_chat/img05.PNG)

## Scrolling

Now, if you keep adding messages, you will notice that your messages will scroll up and eventually disappear. We want the window to be scrollable in order to actually check our history.

To better work this out, let's modify our `AddMessageToChatHistory` so that it will echo the message 100 times:

```
def AddMessageToChatHistory(self, message):
    chat_text = self.chat_widget.text
    for i in range(100):
        chat_text = chat_text + "\n\n" + str(i) + " - " + message
    self.chat_widget.text = chat_text
```

Now, let's include our chat window into a `ScrollView`. Change the `BackgroundLabel` section in `console.kv` to look like this:

```
ScrollView:
    id: scroll_view_id
    do_scroll_y: True
    do_scroll_x: False
    size_hint: (1,None)
    height: Window.height
    BackgroundLabel:
        id: chat_widget_id
        text: "Welcome to the Chat Widget"
        color: 0,0,0,1
        size_hint: (1,None)
        text_size: (self.width, None)
        height: max(scroll_view_id.height, self.texture_size[1])
        halign: 'left'
```

This proved to be quite complex to accomplish, so let's review it line by line.

```
ScrollView
```

instantiate an instance of `[ScrollView Class](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.scrollview.html)`

```
id: scroll_view_id
```

assigns it a name to reference it later

```
do_scroll_y: True
do_scroll_x: False
```

tells it to scroll only vertically

```
size_hint: (1, None)
```

tells it to adjust horizontally but not vertically.

```
scroll_y: 0
```

tells it to always scroll to the bottom. This way we will always see the last message added.

```
height: Window.height - input_widget.height
```

bind its height to the window's height. The Window class is imported via the directive

```
#:import Window kivy.core.window.Window
```

As per the `BackgroundLabel`, it is now contained into the `ScrollView` and modified to

```
size_hint: (1, None)
```

adjust horizontally but not vertically.

```
text_size: (self.width, None)
```

bound the text horizontally but not vertically. In other words, the text will wrap at the end of the line, but has no vertical limit.

```
height: max(scroll_view_id.height, self.texture_size[1])
```

bounds the height of the text to the height of the scroll window or the vertical size of the text into the widget, whatever is greater.

This way, the text into the `chat_widget` can grow vertically as it's needed and the `ScrollView` will always show us a specific portion of it, the size of the window, that we can move as we like.

Now, go on and execute the app. Insert a test message. This will be echoed 100 times and you should be able to scroll through the history.

![Fig. 6](/assets/img/kivy_chat/img06.PNG)

Remember to change the `AddMessageToChatHistory` method back to its original form:

```
def AddMessageToChatHistory(self, message):
    chat_text = self.chat_widget.text
    chat_text = chat_text + "\n\n" + message
    self.chat_widget.text = chat_text
```

## Questions and Answers

Up to now, our chat does very little. Now it's time to add a way to send our messages and receive back answers.

Let's start very simply by adding the following method to our `ConsoleController` class:

```
def send_question(self, question):
    answer = "This is my answer to your question: " + question
    self.AddMessageToChatHistory(answer, type="answer")
    return answer
```

It basically receives a question, prepend it with "This is my answer to your question: " and provide it back to the user. We still don't have the "send and receive" channel, so we'll simulate it by inserting the answer in the chat flow as a `type="answer"` message.

We want a way to visually identify questions and answers, so let's say that answers will be in blue text indented and modify the `AddMessageToChatHistory` method accordingly.

```
def AddMessageToChatHistory(self, message, type="question"):
    if type is "question":
        text_col = "#000000"
        text_prompt = ""
    else:
        text_col ="#0000FF"
        text_prompt = "     >>>>> "
    chat_text = self.chat_widget.text
    chat_text = f"{chat_text}\n\n[color={text_col}]{text_prompt}{message}[/color]"
    self.chat_widget.text = chat_text
```
In order for the `[color]` markup to work, we must add the following property to our `BackgroundLabel` in `console.kv`:

```
markup: True
```

Now, let's modify the `chat_input_callback` to send the question and we should have our conversation done.

```
def chat_input_callback(self, message):
    self.AddMessageToChatHistory(message)
    self.send_question(message)
    self.input_widget.text = ""
    return False
```

![Fig. 7](/assets/img/kivy_chat/img07.PNG)

## Talking With A Server

We've come a long way since we started. We are now able to send a message and receive and answer, but all is inside the same application. It could be useful, but what we really want is to be able to communicate with a remote server.

Let's try and implement such a server using [python-socketio](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

First of all, create a server to handle events from the console. In a `server.py` file add the following:

```
import eventlet
import socketio

sio = socketio.Server()
app = socketio.WSGIApp(sio)


@sio.event
def connect(sid, environ):
    print("Connection received from client: ", sid)


@sio.event
def disconnect(sid):
    print(" Client disconnecting")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    eventlet.wsgi.server(eventlet.listen(("127.0.0.1", 8000)), app)
```

Now, modify the `console.py` to use socket client-server communications.

```
import socketio

[...]

class ConsoleApp(App):
    """
    The Console Application
    """

    def build(self):
        self.title = "Chat Console"
        return ConsoleController()

    def on_start(self):
        Logger.info("Application: Application starting")
        self.sio = socketio.Client(logger=Logger)
        self.sio.connect("http://127.0.0.1:8000")

    def on_stop(self):
        Logger.info("Application: Application stopping")
        self.sio.disconnect()
```

Here, we have added two methods to the `ConsoleApp` class.

`on_start` creates a socket channel when the application starts, and connect it to the server.

`on_stop` disconnect from the server when we close the application.

Now, in a console window start the `server.py`. You should see something like:

```
(276) wsgi starting up on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

In another console, start the application. You should get something in the logs like:

```
[INFO   ] [Application ] Application starting
[INFO   ] Engine.IO connection established
[INFO   ] Namespace / is connected
[INFO   ] [Base        ] Start application main loop
```

and in the server window now you should have

```
(276) accepted ('127.0.0.1', 59045)
Connection received from client:  2ddbe965b08d4a19ac7b80f89c796b06
127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jan/2020 01:39:07] "GET /socket.io/?transport=polling&EIO=3&t=1578271147.2916405 HTTP/1.1" 200 349 0.001000
(276) accepted ('127.0.0.1', 59046)
```

Note the line `Connection received from client...`. This is printed by our server in response to a connection event.

Wonderful! Our desktop console is talking to a remote server.

## Exchanging Messages

So, the next step is to let the server handle the user input and provide an answer.

We are going to modify our `console.py` so that in response to a user input, it will update the `chat_widget` and send an event to the server. The server will process the event, produce the answer and send an event to the console. The console will then update the `chat_widget` with the server's answer.

Let's go.

First of all, since we have defined our socket in the `ConsoleApp` class, let's move the `chat_input_callback` in this class.

```
class ConsoleApp(App):
    """
    The Console Application
    """

    def build(self):
        self.title = "Chat Console"
        self.controller = ConsoleController()
        return self.controller

    def on_start(self):
        Logger.info("Application: Application starting")
        self.sio = socketio.Client(logger=Logger)
        self.sio.connect("http://127.0.0.1:8000")
        self.sio.on("server_answer", self.server_answer)

    def on_stop(self):
        Logger.info("Application: Application stopping")
        self.sio.disconnect()

    def chat_input_callback(self, message):
        Logger.info(f"Application: Received user input: {message}")
        self.controller.AddMessageToChatHistory(message)
        self.controller.input_widget.text = ""
        self.sio.emit("chat_user_input", message)
        return False

    def server_answer(self, message):
        Logger.info(f"Application: Received answer from server: {message}")
        self.controller.AddMessageToChatHistory(message, type="answer")
```

The `chat_input_callback` method is the same as before, except that it emits a `chat_user_input` event for the server.

The `server_answer` method is the handler for the server's event. The handler is binded to the event in the `on_start` method by the `self.sio.on()` statement.

In `console.kv` change the binding for `on_text_validate` event to point to the new callback:

```
on_text_validate: app.chat_input_callback(self.text)
```

In `server.py` create the `chat_user_input` handler:

```
@sio.event
def chat_user_input(sid, message):
    print(f"Received user input: {message}")
    payload = "This is my answer to your question: " + message
    sio.emit("server_answer", payload, room=sid)
```

That's it. Start the console and type your input. On the client log you should see:

```
[INFO   ] [Application ] Application starting
[INFO   ] Engine.IO connection established
[INFO   ] Namespace / is connected
[INFO   ] [Base        ] Start application main loop
[INFO   ] [Application ] Received user input: Hello there!
[INFO   ] Emitting event "chat_user_input" [/]
[INFO   ] Received event "server_answer" [/]
[INFO   ] [Application ] Received answer from server: This is my answer to your question: Hello there!
```

while on the server the corresponding flow is:

```
(1636) wsgi starting up on http://127.0.0.1:8000
(1636) accepted ('127.0.0.1', 59384)
Connection received from client:  522ca95dd5da4aa3bcdd551517a37d44
127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jan/2020 02:24:54] "GET /socket.io/?transport=polling&EIO=3&t=1578273894.2962816 HTTP/1.1" 200 349 0.000996
(1636) accepted ('127.0.0.1', 59385)

```

## Conclusion
This is of course a very basic tutorial. The Socket's world is more complex than this and a lot is missing here, but this is just the first step: I started playing with Socket.io and Kivy just a couple of days ago.

I hope you'd find this tutorial instructive. It certainly was for me. What I recorded in this article is my flow of thoughts, issues and resolutions. Feel free to reuse the above instructions in your own project.

Learn smart, code hard, have fun!
