# How to setup a Kubernetes environment for learning purposes
###### Last Updated: {{ page.last_update | date: "%A, %B %d, %Y" }}

So, you decided to give Kubernetes a go eh? You brave fool!

I made the same decision once, not exactly for pleasure but because I needed to. Here is how I set up my first k8s environment on a virtual machine.

## 1 - References
To completed this tutorial I consulted the following documentation:
* [Setting a Kubernetes cluster on Ubuntu VirtualBox: The lost guide](https://medium.com/@dcarrascal75/setting-a-kubernetes-cluster-on-ubuntu-virtualbox-the-lost-guide-73706e28bc5b) by [David Carrascal](https://medium.com/@dcarrascal75?source=post_page-----73706e28bc5b----------------------)
* [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)


## 2 - Environment
My environment consist of a Lenovo T490, equipped with an Intel Core i7-8665U CPU and 40 GB of RAM.

The hypervisor used to run K8S is 'Oracle VirtualBox 6.1'.

The host OS is Windows 10.

The guest OS for K8S is Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS.

[Putty](http://www.putty.org/) will be use to SSH login into the VMs.

> **Note**: You can choose to install any other OS versions, including a Desktop one. But since this is a learning environment, I think it is best to keep it as similar as possible to a production one (which include learning how to use the OS environment).

In this tutorial I assume you have the hypervisor installed and that you know how to create a VM in VirtualBox. I'll report only details about configuration of such VMs.

## 3 - Create the base VM
The first step is to create a base VM from which we'll later clone the K8S nodes. This basically means to create the VM and configure some features that will be useful later. I'll call this first VM `k8sBase`. My base machine has the following characteristics:

* Memory size = 1024 MB
* Create a virtual hard disk now
    * Hard Disk type : VDI
    * Dynamically allocated
    * Size 10GB

Now, start the newly created VM, load your ISO image and completed a basic configuration of the server. When presented with the option, `Install OpenSSH server` so that you will be able to remotely connect to this machine. Do not install any of the popular snaps: we are learning!

Once finished, restart your server and update/upgrade:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

### 3.1 - Install Docker
Instructions about how to install Docker for a Kubernetes environment are available at the official Kubernetes documentation page [Container runtimes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#docker). They also point to the [Official Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

```
# Install Docker CE
## Set up the repository:
### Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common gnupg2

### Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -

### Add Docker apt repository.
sudo add-apt-repository \
  "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) \
  stable"

## Install Docker CE.
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  containerd.io=1.2.13-1 \
  docker-ce=5:19.03.8~3-0~ubuntu-$(lsb_release -cs) \
  docker-ce-cli=5:19.03.8~3-0~ubuntu-$(lsb_release -cs)

# Setup daemon.
sudo cat > /etc/docker/daemon.json <<EOF
{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m"
  },
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
EOF

sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d

# Restart docker.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Verifyt that Docker Engine is installed correctly
sudo docker run hello-world
```

### 3.2 - Configure the Kubernetes repositories

Add kubernetes to the apt repository list and add the Google's official pgp key

```
$ sudo sh -c "echo 'deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list"

$ sudo sh -c "curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -"

$ sudo apt-get update
```

## 4 - Create your Kubernetes VM
Now that you have your base machine, you can close it to create your first kubernetes nodes. Name them "k8sMaster" and "k8sNode1" respectively.

![Fig. 1.1 - Cloning k8sMaster](/assets/img/k8s_learning/img01_1.png)
![Fig. 1.2 - Cloning k8sMaster](/assets/img/k8s_learning/img01_2.png)

## 5 - Setting up the Network configuration
We are going to provide each of the kubernetes nodes with a static host-only ip address to use for kubernetes, in addition to the one provided by the NAT that they will use to reach the internet.

This way, they will be able to talk to each other and we can reach them from the host machine.

Check the ip addresses you are using in your environment, because you don't want to overlap with your production environment.

If you don't have one already (or if you want to use a dedicated one for your kubernetes cluster), got to **Virtualbox > File > Host Network Manager > Create** and create an adapter. Let all the default values and check the DHCP checker.

![Fig. 2.1 - Creating the Host Adapter](/assets/img/k8s_learning/img02_1.png))
![Fig. 2.2 - Creating the Host Adapter](/assets/img/k8s_learning/img02_2.png))

Now enable the `Host-only Adapter` for `k8sMaster` and `k8sNode1`.

![Fig. 3 - Enable the Host Adapter](/assets/img/k8s_learning/img03.png))

Now start `k8sMaster` and check the network interfaces with `ifconfig -a`. Identify the one attached to the Host Adapter. If you are in doubt, note that when you created the adapter it provided you with a MAC Address you can use for this task. In my configuration, the right one is called `enp0s8`.

![Fig. 4 - Identify the interface](/assets/img/k8s_learning/img04.png))

Let's configure it with the static ip address `192.168.56.10` (check your configuration to know what address use in your configuration).

```
$ ls /etc/netplan
50-cloud-init.yaml

$ sudo vi /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Modify the content of the file as follows:

```
network:
    ethernets:
        enp0s3:
            dhcp4: true
        enp0s8:
            addresses:
                - 192.168.56.10/24
    version: 2
```

Then apply the configuration with `sudo netplan apply`. More examples about netplan are available [here](https://netplan.io/examples).

Do the same for `k8sNode1` configuring the ipaddress `192.168.56.11`.

Now, verify that:

1. you can reach internet from both the VM: `ping 1.1.1.1` - `ping google.com`
2. you can reach both VM from your host: `ping 192.168.56.10` `ping 192.168.56.11`
3. the two VM can ping each other

Now change the hostname of the two VM to reflect their role. On each VM run the following commands (using the appropriate hostname for each one):

```
$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname k8sMaster
aizzi$ sudo reboot
```

## 6 - Generate keys to login from host
On the host, create a key-pair using `ssh-keygen`. It will be stored in `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`.

Now ssh to `k8sMaster`:

```
$ sudo mkdir ~/.ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh
$ sudo vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    <paste the public key you copied in the clipboard and save the file. You can use the right mouse button to paste.>
$ sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/.ssh/
```

Now you can login directly into the machines without providing the password: `ssh aizzi@192.168.56.10`.

> **Note** : I'm not going to explore how to use multiple keys from one client to connect to different servers. If you need it, [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419566/best-way-to-use-multiple-ssh-private-keys-on-one-client) and [this article](https://www.concurrency.com/blog/may-2019/key-based-authentication-for-openssh-on-windows) and [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52113738/starting-ssh-agent-on-windows-10-fails-unable-to-start-ssh-agent-service-erro) could be a good starting point.

## 7 - Installing kubernetes components on the Master

As detailed in the [Before you begin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#before-you-begin) section of the Kubernetes documentation, there are some pre-requisites for the virtual machine.

1. Increase the VM RAM to 2GB (or more, as you need)

![Fig. 5 - Increase System Memory](/assets/img/k8s_learning/img05.png))

> **Note** This is **mandatory on k8sMaster**, optional on the nodes.

2. Increase the number of processors to 2

![Fig. 6 - Increase Processor Numbers](/assets/img/k8s_learning/img06.png))

> **Note** This is **mandatory on k8sMaster**, optional on the nodes.

3. Verify the MAC address are unique for every node

We should have taken care of this aspect during the cloning of the VMs, but it is worth double-checking now.

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ ifconfig enp0s8
enp0s8: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.56.10  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.56.255

```

```
aizzi@k8sNode1:~$ ifconfig enp0s8
enp0s8: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.56.11  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.56.255
        inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe0d:4f3  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>

        TX packets 118  bytes 15077 (15.0 KB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

4. Verify that the product_uuid are unique for every node

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid
[sudo] password for aizzi:
DBAAE751-1BBB-C24F-AB8D-234277D11CD4
```

```
aizzi@k8sNode1:~$ sudo cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid
[sudo] password for aizzi:
0D496210-45BA-B440-B807-1587CD80E83C
```

5. Disable the `swap`

On both VM execute

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo swapoff -a
```

Then edit the `/etc/fstab` file and comment out the swap line

```
#/swap.img      none    swap    sw      0       0
```

6. Letting iptables see bridged traffic

On both VM, make sure the `br_netfilter` module is loaded:

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ lsmod | grep br_netfilter
br_netfilter           24576  0
bridge                155648  1 br_netfilter
```

If it is not running, you can load it explicitly by calling `sudo modprobe br_netfilter`.

Next, execute the following:

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
EOF
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo sysctl --system
```

7. Install `kubeadm`, `kubelet` and `kubectl`

`kubeadm` is the command to bootstrap the cluster.

`kubelet` is the component that runs all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers

`kubectl` is the command line util to talk to your cluster

> **Note** : These components *should* be at the same version across your environment (although *one* minor version skew between the kubelet and the control plane is supported).

Optionally, hold your kubernetes packages in order to not being updated:

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
kubelet set on hold.
kubeadm set on hold.
kubectl set on hold.
```

Now, you can initialize your K8S Master with using the [`kubeadm init` command](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init/):

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address=192.168.56.10 --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
```

> **Note** : The `--pod-network-cidr` value is the default CIDR used by `Calico`, a Pod network CIDR we'll install in the next step. For Calico to work correctly, you need to pass this same CIDR to `kubeadm init`.

This command will take a while to run, but at the end you should see something like this:

```
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 192.168.56.10:6443 --token lqrmgg.1o827uq2udy7mih2 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:30b8da498c9a0bc9e4458cc4c6ef93ddb9c9218ea8d37177214e35d35f054ef7
```

If you look at the command's output, you'll note that it contains several commands to run, as well as a `kubadm join` command with the token that you'll need to join a new node to the cluste. **Copy and keep this line for future reuse**.

> **Note** : The token is used for mutual authentication between the control-plane node and the joining nodes. The token included here is secret. Keep it safe, because anyone with this token can add authenticated nodes to your cluster. These tokens can be listed, created, and deleted with the `kubeadm token` command.

So, move on and run the suggested commands:

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube

aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config

aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

## 8 - Installing a Pod network add-on

As detailed [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/#pod-network), it is now time to deploy a `Container Network Interface (CNI)` based Pod network add-on so that your Pods can communicate with each other.

Currently, [`Calico`](http://docs.projectcalico.org/) is the only CNI plugin that the kubeadm project performs e2e test against, so this is what we are going to install here.

Install Calico by running the following command:

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.11/manifests/calico.yaml
configmap/calico-config created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/felixconfigurations.crd.projectcalico.org created

```

## 9 - Enable the Master to host pods

By default, your cluster will not schedule Pods on the control-plane node for security reasons. If this is good for productions environment, running a local test environment this is a waste of precious resources.

If you wish, you can enable the master node to run pods with the following command:

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-
node/k8smaster untainted
```

And with this, you're ready to add nodes to your cluster.

## 10 - Adding a Node

Move to `k8sNode1` and install kubernetes:

```
aizzi@k8sNode1:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl

aizzi@k8sNode1:~$ curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

aizzi@k8sNode1:~$ cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
> deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
> EOF

aizzi@k8sNode1:~$ sudo apt-get update

aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

Optionally, hold your kubernetes packages in order to not being updated:

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

Now, copy and paste the `kubeadm join` command from the Master:

```
aizzi@k8sNode1:~$ sudo kubeadm join 192.168.56.10:6443 --token lqrmgg.1o827uq2udy7mih2 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:30b8da498c9a0bc9e4458cc4c6ef93dd

[kubelet-start] Writing kubelet configuration to file "/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml"
[kubelet-start] Writing kubelet environment file with flags to file "/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env"
[kubelet-start] Starting the kubelet
[kubelet-start] Waiting for the kubelet to perform the TLS Bootstrap...

This node has joined the cluster:
* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and a response was received.
* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the control-plane to see this node join the cluster.
```

Wait a little bit and check that the Node is visible from the Master:

```
aizzi@k8sMaster:~$ kubectl get nodes
NAME        STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
k8smaster   Ready    master   123m   v1.18.2
k8snode1    Ready    <none>   116s   v1.18.2
```

## 11 - Conclusions

You now have a 2-node kubernetes cluster to play with. 

Of course, this is only the starting point: there is a lot more to explore before to use Kubernetes.

A good place to start could be the [Tutorials page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) website.

Learn smart, code hard, have fun!
